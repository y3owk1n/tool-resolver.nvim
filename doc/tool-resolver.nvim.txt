1. tool-resolver.nvim                  *tool-resolver.nvim-tool-resolver.nvim*

Resolve project-local CLI tools in Neovim with monorepo-aware logic.


FEATURES                      *tool-resolver.nvim-tool-resolver.nvim-features*

- Monorepo-friendly: climbs up directory tree to find local binaries
- Falls back to monorepo root if needed
- Global fallback to system binary if no local match
- Smart per-buffer resolution (works as you switch files)
- Lightweight, dependency-free


  [!NOTE] This plugin only supports node projects at this moment, feel free to
  contribute for more language resolvers if this plugin interests you.

HOW IT WORKS              *tool-resolver.nvim-tool-resolver.nvim-how-it-works*

When resolving a tool (e.g. `biome`), this plugin:

1. Starts at the file’s directory
2. Traverses upward to find the nearest executable based on configured type, for `node` it will be at `node_modules/.bin/biome`
3. If none is found, tries the same logic from `vim.fn.getcwd()` (monorepo root fallback)
4. If still not found, falls back to the fallbacks tool name specified in configuration or the global tool name (e.g. "biome")


INSTALLATION              *tool-resolver.nvim-tool-resolver.nvim-installation*

Using lazy.nvim <https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim>

>lua
    -- tool-resolver.lua
    return {
     "y3owk1n/tool-resolver.nvim",
     version = "*", -- remove this if you want to use the `main` branch
     opts = {
      -- your configuration comes here
      -- or leave it empty to use the default settings
      -- refer to the configuration section below
     }
    }
<

Ifyou are using other package managers you need to call `setup`

>lua
    require("tool-resolver").setup({
      -- your configuration
    })
<


REQUIREMENTS ~

- Neovim0.11+ with Lua support


CONFIGURATION            *tool-resolver.nvim-tool-resolver.nvim-configuration*

The default configurations are as below.


DEFAULT OPTIONS ~

>lua
    ---@type ToolResolver.Config
    {
     tools = {},
    }
<


TYPE DEFINITIONS ~

>lua
    ---@class ToolResolver.Config
    ---@field tools table<string, ToolResolver.Config.Tools> tools with type and fallback
    
    ---@class ToolResolver.Config.Tools
    ---@field type ToolResolver.ResolverType
    ---@field fallback? string fallback binary name, if not specified then use the key.
<


QUICK START                *tool-resolver.nvim-tool-resolver.nvim-quick-start*

See the example below for how to configure **tool-resolver.nvim**.

>lua
    {
     "y3owk1n/tool-resolver.nvim",
     cmd = {
      "ToolResolverGet",
      "ToolResolverClearCache",
      "ToolResolverGetCache",
     },
     ---@type ToolResolver.Config
     opts = {
       -- register the tools that you want to use here
       tools = {
        biome = {
         type = "node", -- type is required, and only "node" is supported for now
        },
        prettier = {
         type = "node", -- type is required, and only "node" is supported for now
         fallback = "prettierd", -- specifify a fallback binary name will resolve to this, else will fallback to the key `prettier`
        },
       },
     },
    },
<

You can then use the following to resolve a tool anywhere. For example in my
biome LSP config:

>lua
    local tr = require("tool-resolver.tools")
    
    ---@type vim.lsp.Config
    return {
     cmd = { tr.get_bin("biome"), "lsp-proxy" }, -- instead of just getting it from the global bin, use tool-resolver for it.
     -- the rest of your lsp configurations
    }
<


API                                *tool-resolver.nvim-tool-resolver.nvim-api*

**tool-resolver.nvim** provides the following api functions that you can use
for different things:


GET THE LOCAL OR GLOBAL TOOL BIN ~

This is the most important function in **tool-resolver.nvim**. It will try to
resolve the tool bin from the current buffer to the node modules available
binary, and only fallback to the globally installed version.

>lua
    ---@class ToolResolver.GetBinOpts
    ---@field path? string start search path (default: current buffer)
    
    ---@param tool string
    ---@param opts? ToolResolver.GetBinOpts
    ---@return string
    require("tool-resolver.tools").get_bin(tool, opts)
