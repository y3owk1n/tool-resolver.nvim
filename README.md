# üß∞ tool-resolver.nvim

Resolve project-local CLI tools in Neovim with monorepo-aware logic. (Only for node projects, extremely useful for tools like `biome` or `prettier`)

> No `plenary`, no guesswork ‚Äî just fast, reliable resolution of `node_modules/.bin/<tool>` per buffer.

<!-- panvimdoc-ignore-start -->

## üí° Motivation

I ran into constant version mismatch issues when using tools like biome globally ‚Äî especially in monorepos or older projects that don‚Äôt use the latest version. This often resulted in frustrating errors, even when everything seemed properly set up.

At that point, I had two choices:

- üöß Upgrade every project to use the latest tool versions (not always ideal or even possible)
- ‚úÖ Resolve the tool binary per project, based on its local installation

So, I built this plugin to make the second option easy and seamless.

While tools like mason.nvim are great, they typically install the latest versions globally ‚Äî which doesn‚Äôt help when you need project-specific versions. **tool-resolver.nvim** fills that gap with fast, reliable, and monorepo-aware resolution of `node_modules/.bin/<tool>` for each buffer.

## üöÄ Features

- Monorepo-friendly: climbs up directory tree to find local binaries
- Falls back to monorepo root if needed
- Global fallback to system binary if no local match
- Smart per-buffer resolution (works as you switch files)
- Lightweight, dependency-free

> [!NOTE]
> This plugin only supports node projects at this moment, as the detection are hard-coded to work with `node_modules/.bin/<tool>`.

## üß† How It Works

When resolving a tool (e.g. `biome`), this plugin:

1. Starts at the file's directory
2. Traverses upward to find the nearest executable at `node_modules/.bin/biome`
3. If none is found, tries the same logic from `vim.fn.getcwd()` (monorepo root fallback)
4. If still not found, falls back to the fallbacks tool name specified in configuration or the global tool name (e.g. "biome")

## üì¶ Installation

Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
-- tool-resolver.lua
return {
 "y3owk1n/tool-resolver.nvim",
 version = "*", -- remove this if you want to use the `main` branch
 opts = {
  -- your configuration comes here
  -- or leave it empty to use the default settings
  -- refer to the configuration section below
 }
}
```

If you are using other package managers you need to call `setup`:

```lua
require("tool-resolver").setup({
  -- your configuration
})
```

### Requirements

- Neovim 0.11+ with Lua support

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The default configurations are as below.

### Default Options

```lua
---@type ToolResolver.Config
{
 fallbacks = {},
}
```

### Type Definitions

```lua
---@class ToolResolver.Config
---@field fallbacks? table<string, string> Register fallbacks here
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

See the example below for how to configure **tool-resolver.nvim**.

```lua
{
 "y3owk1n/tool-resolver.nvim",
 cmd = {
  "ToolResolverGet",
  "ToolResolverClearCache",
  "ToolResolverGetCache",
 },
 ---@type ToolResolver.Config
 opts = {
   -- register the fallbacks that you want to use here
   fallbacks = {
    biome = "biome",
    prettier = "prettierd", -- this is an example of a custom fallback, instead of fallback to `prettier`, fallback to `prettierd` instead.
   },
 },
},
```

You can then use the following to resolve a tool anywhere. For example in my biome LSP config:

```lua
local tr = require("tool-resolver.tools")

---@type vim.lsp.Config
return {
 cmd = { tr.get_bin("biome"), "lsp-proxy" }, -- instead of just getting it from the global bin, use tool-resolver for it.
 -- the rest of your lsp configurations
}
```

## üåé API

**tool-resolver.nvim** provides the following api functions that you can use for different things:

### Get the local or global tool bin

This is the most important function in **tool-resolver.nvim**. It will try to resolve the tool bin from the current buffer to the node modules available binary, and only fallback to the globally installed version.

```lua
---@param tool string
---@param opts? ToolResolver.GetBinOpts
---@return string
require("tool-resolver.tools").get_bin(tool, opts)
```
